The project goal is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equiment at auction based on it's usage, 
equipment type, and configuaration.  The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.

The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

In this project I learnt:
  1- Using  pandas to manipulate data such as reading datasets, 
     getting summarization about the dataframe, dealing with missing values, and dealing with categorical data.
  2- Using seaborn and matplotlib to generata graphs for EDA.
  3- Using fastai functions for advanced data manipulation.
  4- Using sklearn to train different machine learning models and find the best model to get the best score.
